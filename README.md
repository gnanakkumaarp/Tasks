//  typeof(1) gives number as output
 
console.log("typeof(1.1) gives " + typeof(1) + " as output"); 

// typeof(1.1) gives number as output

console.log("typeof(true) gives " + typeof(true) + " as output"); 

// typeof(true) gives boolean as output

console.log("typeof(null) gives " + typeof(null) + " as output"); 

// typeof(null) gives object as output 

console.log("typeof(undefined) gives " + typeof(undefined) + " as output"); 

// typeof(undefined) gives undefined as output  

console.log("typeof([]) gives " + typeof(1) + " as output"); 

// typeof([]) gives number as output  

console.log("typeof(NaN) gives " + typeof(NaN) + " as output");

# Differeces between HTML Tags 

   # <div> <article> and <section>
   
        These are html tags used to group the content together
       
   # <section> and <article>```
    
           content should contain heading h1,h2,h3 like that
           content together shoud make sense
  
   # <article>
    
           content shoulb be standalone
    
   # <div>
    
           Everything else can be grouped under <div> like lists, links etc.
